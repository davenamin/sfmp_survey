trying again, to see if this process can be made easier with KoBoToolbox.

-install virtualbox and vagrant
- clone https://github.com/kobotoolbox/dist-kobo-devel

in directory, "vagrant up". it gets the ubuntu/trusty32 box for virtualbox.

i'm downloading it via safari so that i can resume the (inevitably failed) download. just a helpful tip in case you're in-country

https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/trusty/current/trusty-server-cloudimg-i386-vagrant-disk1.box

I moved it to ~ and ran
export VM_BOX="file://~/trusty-server-cloudimg-i386-vagrant-disk1.box"

i had to replace the nameserver in resolv.conf with 8.8.8.8 <- that wasted some time for sure.

i ran "vagrant ssh" then "~/scripts/00_vagrant_up.sh". I gave the password as "vagrant" which seemed to work...

needed to set the password for the postgres user after postgres was installed. ran "sudo -u postgres psql postgres" then "\password postgres" and set it "vagrant"

oops no had to change that line in the script to use sudo with -u postgres and -i

it takes a lot of runs. but eventually? maybe? yup. need to use "kobo/kobo" at the django web interface (address/admin/) to add new users. seems to work after that!
